## C++

* [Jason Turner - C++ Weekly (YT)](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxHAlbZQNFU2LgEtiqd2Maw/videos)

Jason is the author of the header only library [ChaiScript](https://chaiscript.com/index.html) and co-host of [CppCast](https://cppcast.com) and regular speaker on C++ Conferences, usually holding talks about best practices & compile time programming with constexpr.

In his C++ Weekly episodes he covers short topics about C++, e.g. taking a look at features of the latest / upcomming standard using the [compiler explorer](https://godbolt.org). During the pandemic he also does occasional streams, that run longer and look at larger projects (C&C source) or even converting them from C to C++ (Doom)

* [Cpp Cast](https://cppcast.com)

Weekly podcast hosted by Rob Irving and Jason Turner. Covers the latest C++ news and most episodes feature a guest, that is related to the episode's main topic (e.g. trip reports from ISO Committee members, conference recaps).

* [Herb Sutter - Sutterâ€™s Mill (Blog)](https://herbsutter.com/)

Chair of the ISO C++ standards committee, native languages architect at Microsoft and regular conference speaker. The blog posts usually fall into one of two categories: 
  - Guru of the Week - in depth look at certain C++ topics
  - ISO Trip reports - recaps of recent committee meetings

* [Jonathan Boccara - FluentC++](http://www.fluentcpp.com/)

The weekly blog posts usually focus on writing expressive code, but may also take a deeper dive into the inner workings of certain C++ functions.

* [C++ Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp)

User submitted discussions, articles and news (e.g tool upgrades, interesting proposals) about C++. Has a "sister" subreddit for C++ related [questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp_questions/).

### Conferences

Just like C++ itself, the topics for these conferences usually cover a rather wide range - high level concepts and more theroretical discussions (e.g. APIs Design) on one end and getting to close to the [metal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSkpMdDe4g4) on the other.

* Features of the upcomming standard
* Advanced topics (e.g. move semantics, copy elision etc.)
* Using c++ in special fields - embedded, gpu programming
* Best practices
* "Back to Basics" / beginner topics
* Compilers & Tools (editors, static analyzers, sanitizers etc.)
* Software / High-level design
